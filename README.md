# Characterizing Seascapes taxonomically using OBIS Data over Florida Keys Area

## Paper Outline

### TODO
+ Identify spatiotemporal region-of-interests (RoIs) to use as case-studies
  + RoIs should have lots of data
  + RoIs should have a scientifically interesting “data story”
+ Identify potential publication venues

### Notes
+ author list: 
  + Ayush Anand, 
  + (student from IMaRS or elsewhere)?, Maria?, Enrique?, Joaquin?, Matt Biddle, 
  + Tylar Murray

### Outline
+ Seascapes overview
  + Seascapes are useful dimensional reduction technique for sat MODIS-based satellite products
  + Seascapes represent habitat classifications in terms of satellite-derived water parameters
+ Why seascapes are valuable
  + Ocean habitats are much more transient than land habitats. Seascapes move with the changing water parameters, thus better representing the marine environment at a particular time. This feature is especially important for species which migrate and those that move with ocean currents.
  + In addition to the transient seascape class at a given time, a location can be characterized by the integration of seascape classes which occur in this location over time. 
    + TODO: stream-graph plot of seascapes over time for a region
+ Taxonomic characterization of seascapes:
  + What species are the most common in each of the seascapes?
  + What are unique taxonomic features of each seascape?
+ Species characterization using seascapes:
  + For a given species of interest:
    + What seascapes does the species primarily inhabit?
    + Does the species migrate between seascapes seasonally?
